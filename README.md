# Netforge

A personal playground for learning low-level network programming in C.

## About This Project

Netforge is my collection of small C programs created to explore fundamental networking concepts like sockets, system calls (`poll()`), and protocol logic. This project is a hands-on learning exercise, not a professional library. The goal is to learn by building from scratch.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains a growing collection of command-line tools focused on two main areas:

* **Simple Chat System:** Components to build a basic multi-client chat application. This includes a `pollserver` capable of handling concurrent connections and a corresponding `client`.
* **Network Diagnostic Utilities:** Tools for analyzing and scanning networks. The main example is `scanner`, an efficient TCP port scanner that uses non-blocking sockets to check multiple ports in parallel.
