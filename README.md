# netforge

This is my personal playground for learning low-level network programming in C.

## What is this?

I'm building a small collection of C programs to experiment with networking concepts like sockets, protocols, and data packets. This isn't meant to be a polished library or a set of professional tools. It's just a place for me to have fun and figure out how things work from scratch.

The whole idea is to learn by doing.

## My Current Experiments

Here's what I've built so far:

* `server`: A simple chat server that can handle just one connection.
* `pollserver`: A simple chat server that can handle multiple clients at once using the `poll()` system call.
* `client`: A basic client to connect to the server and send messages.

I'll be adding more tools as I learn new things.

## How to Build and Run

If you want to try them out, hereâ€™s how. You'll need `gcc` and `make`.

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/netforge.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/netforge.git)
    cd netforge
    ```

2.  **Compile everything:**
    ```sh
    make
    ```
    This puts the programs in the `bin/` folder.

3.  **Run the server and client:**
    Open two separate terminals.

    In the first terminal, start the server:
    ```sh
    ./bin/pollserver
    ```
    In the second terminal, start the client:
    ```sh
    ./bin/client
    ```
